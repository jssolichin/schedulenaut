Schedule Smarter Together.

Schedulenaut is an open source project and idea born out of the need to schedule meetings and events more effectively; who doesnâ€™t have to schedule with someone? 

**Why is this different?** Time is a continuous measurement; current solutions use checkboxes and other traditional form elements which are designed for discrete types. Schedulenaut utilizes D3 to beautifully create a data visualization of time availability. Moreover, it allows for different types of priority, allowing event organizer to make optimal decisions.
