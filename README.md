Schedule Smarter Together.

Schedulenaut is an open source project and idea born out of the need to schedule meetings and events more effectively; who doesnâ€™t have to schedule with someone? Although there are many tools to help use meetings and run events more efficiently, there is surprisingly a lack of solutions to make those meetings and events happen.
